This chatbot is developed to enable **interactive and intelligent conversations** and is designed to be **integrated into a website** to enhance user engagement and support.

The project utilizes **NumPy** for efficient numerical computations and array manipulations during data analysis. **JSON-formatted data** is processed using Python’s `json` library to extract and manage structured information effectively.

A **machine learning model** is implemented using the **PyTorch deep learning framework**. Text data is preprocessed using **NLTK utilities**, including stemming and tokenization, to improve the chatbot’s understanding and response accuracy.
